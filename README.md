# Button_Clicker
This was the first time I used JavaScript with HTML and CSS. The first functionality I implemented was that when either of the yellow "like" buttons are clicked on, 
an alert pops up saying "Ninja was liked". The second functionality I implemented was that when the "Login" button is clicked on, it changes to say "Logout". The final 
functionality I implemented was that when the "Add definition" button is clicked on, it disappears. This small assignment was fun to work on and taught me how JavaScript can 
be used with HTML and CSS to add functionality to the webpage.
